No one really knows the future and yet bets can be made on hypotheticals powered by billions of dollars in advertising. Sometimes those trends can become reality but if the technology and users are not ready, it will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question still remains: what is the future and the next chapter of the Internet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the privilege of using the state of the art technology to detect fraud and fake reviews here at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fakespot.com&quot;&gt;Fakespot&lt;/a&gt;. This gives us a great eye on what the pragmatic and objective truths are in technology with what powers our production offerings. This environment is fast-paced with millions of users and constant product innovation. The best way to tell if something is the future is to look at the current utility of that technology and see if it has product market fit with the majority of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does blockchain prove its mettle in that regard? In some ways yes, in some ways no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a fog-of-war of hype trains operated by zealots that makes it even harder to measure. However, there are other technologies developing rapidly in parallel that we can bet on and those may end up being the future of the Internet or at least its de facto theme. Just like Web2 was about the smart-phone and user generated content, let’s look at what virtual or tangible technologies are the pragmatic future of the digital realms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Web3 is not blockchain, NFTs or crypto but machine-generated content. Deep learning and neural networks have expanded to a point that affect many aspects of our daily lives. Ranging from machine-generated recommendations, the voice assistants that set your alarm, or even the easy to forget autocomplete suggestions from Google that are incredibly useful in reducing time spent and errors. Those are examples of machine-generated content powered by neural networks with real-world utility affecting vast tracts of users that are so simple to forget about and yet we are using them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of mega-data transformer based models such as DALL-E, GPT, and many others, we are now witnessing the era of real-time generation of more complex content of images, photos and videos happening right in front of our eyes. This was never possible before but just like the early days of the Internet that catered to a select few technical folks connecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/capn-crunch-whistle&quot;&gt;through a Captain Crunch whistle&lt;/a&gt;, it is exponentially easier to go “on-line” since then and now we are seeing a mass adoption of neural networks in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could the future also include a mash-up of machine-generated content and blockchain + NFTs? I think so, but it has to be done from a product-first or utility-first perspective, something that is lacking in the current marketed Web3 world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saoud Khalifah</name></author><summary type="html">Marketing + hype forge significant powers in influencing trends and narratives.

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://fakespot.com&quot;&gt;Fakespot&lt;/a&gt;, we invest heavily in innovating our proprietary NLP stack to process inauthentic content such as, fake reviews, at scale with the aim of extracting highly valuable insights from text and in turn provide a new look at the data for our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting updates to our platform is the recently released Pros and Cons model which essentially replaces the need for reading reviews! The model is a generative transformer model that “writes” or “composes” its own reviews of the positives and negatives of a product at the level of the GPT derived models we hear about in the press quite often. It has been trained on billions of data points with the model itself utilizing 5 different models under the hood with a really interesting but complex architecture and pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pros/Cons product is now fully rolled out on our Amazon.com Analysis Reports on &lt;a href=&quot;https://fakespot.com&quot;&gt;Fakespot.com&lt;/a&gt; with further expansion across different websites coming very soon (including the mobile apps). Check out the Loom demo video of me demonstrating it below:&lt;/p&gt;

The longer an idea or technology survives through utility or other actions then it is highly probable that the remaining life expectancy is extended. This increased life expectancy may be due to economies of scale, resilience to change, competitiveness, usefulness and much more. As such, the concept describes the link between the age of some non-perishable items and its future life expectancy with the acknowledgement that it mathematically follows the Pareto 80/20 distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are witnessing this effect everywhere around us, especially, as technology and platforms take over our lives. Examples include your smart phone, protocols used by the software on your smart phone and the hardware chips that are within it. It’s highly unlikely you will stop using your smart phone in the near future, or that the software developers will stop using TCP/IP for intermachine network transmission or that Random Access Memory (RAM) chips will become obsolete as the memory vector. Even cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are proving Lindy’s point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get creative beyond technological examples. Ancient books such as Meditations by Marcus Aurelius or Aristotle’s Ethics, have been transcribed over millennia and have undergone a “mass” filtration process by humans over thousands of years, and to this day these books are still useful and impart knowledge to us. You can expect those books to survive even longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;what if you stop trusting Aristotle or Marcus Aurelius?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you stop trusting the software on your phone or your smart phone maker?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are interesting questions to ponder. On the one hand, smart phones are efficient and critical for communication and other use cases such as entertainment, taking photos/videos, etc. On the other hand, if you’re aware that your communication is being spied on and the games on your phone are installing ransomware that blackmails you, &lt;em&gt;would you continue using it&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the answer is quite obvious. There are multiple variables at play here beyond age and lift expectancy. At the top-level we should revise the Lindy effect to include new parameters that are linked together: &lt;strong&gt;entropy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entropy&lt;/strong&gt; is essentially the &lt;strong&gt;measure of chaos or disorder&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; is the &lt;strong&gt;measure of belief, confidence and expectations&lt;/strong&gt; that the technology utilized is reliable, secure and usable with satisfiable results. Key words here are belief and confidence because those are &lt;em&gt;subjective&lt;/em&gt; and expectation of results being &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entropy can be managed by the creator of the technology by fixing bugs and updating the technology. Perception of trust can be manipulated using branding, marketing and PR but it can only go so far since trust can be difficult to manage because of its subjective characteristics that can be deep and personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between entropy and trust is evident and it seems like they move in lockstep with each other. The more chaos there is in a technology, platform or system, we can posit that the trust will start to erode and deteriorate. Once it’s gone, it’s hard to regain it. Users of that technology will start to look for alternatives unless there is a monopoly which means there are no alternatives which can lead to the enablement of inferior products and technologies with the containment of dissatisfied users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the place where innovation can occur since lack of trust and high entropy is a huge opportunity for new entrants bringing a new chapter truly to the Innovator’s Dilemma. When a new solution presents itself when there is lack of trust and high entropy, people will flock to that solution and &lt;strong&gt;the cycle of Lindy’s effect is at play, once again&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saoud Khalifah</name></author><summary type="html">The Lindy Effect is an interesting phenomenon in the sphere of the intangible that is technology.

Each entry will be accompanied by a brief summary of the book and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books (in no particular order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture by Ben Horowitz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/wyd.png&quot; alt=&quot;What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A truly relevant book to me as it addresses the culture that you embed within the company you are building. This book by Ben Horowitz, who is a legend in this industry, enumerates characteristics of different cultures via stories from personal experience or history. There are many learning lessons in this book and it is targeting specifically the building blocks of a sustainable and enduring company culture, one of the cornerstones of a successful business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Japanese culture has an unscrupulous attention to detail due to the awareness of mortality. This reminded me of Steve Job’s mantra (who self-admittedly was heavily inspired by Bushido) in waking up everyday as if thinking it is your last day. That’s how you produce your best work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your personal virtues are what what the culture will ultimately end up valuing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meaningful relationships between team members and team leads is how loyalty is formed. A nice example from Stripe is included in the book.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ben’s experience at Opsware: pivoting the whole company required a lot of maneuvering and leadership jiu jitsu that rested on the cultural values he evoked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interesting take on wartime CEOs like Larry Page, Steve Jobs versus peacetime CEOs ala Tim Cook, Dara Khosrowshahi&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Disagree but commit” in the old days of Netscape resulted in the imperfect (but usable and much needed) Javascript and other tech the Internet is built on today. Nothing built will be perfect and it is more important to start building rather than endlessly debating.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very interesting example involving Genghis Khan and his straying away from the status quo due to diversity and inclusiveness that was anathema to the rule of the day. Valued meritocracy versus aristocracy because of his own upbringing and personal experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coaching, and not management, was crucial for Fairchild Semiconductor. It can be argued it was the progenitor to the general SV culture today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. History Of The Peloponnesian War by Thucydides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/hist.png&quot; alt=&quot;History Of The Peloponnesian War&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read this book previously in excerpts during high school (as some of you probably have) but never gave it a thorough examination from start to finish that it deserved. It’s a good thing I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has been quoted by Winston Churchill and many other preeminent leaders of our times due to its highly influential portrayal of human ideology, desire and spirit. The key lesson here is: Humans and their behaviors have remained unchanged even over 2,400 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pericles’ Funeral Oration was beautiful. I was quite surprised by how Pericles could simulate other peoples behaviors and interpretations of statements he was making so as to prevent any consequential actions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pericles headed the radical democracy that powered Athens in the early years of the Peloponnesian War. Unfortunately, when he passed and without his leadership, everything started to deteriorate. Was that a true democracy then if it rested on the shoulders of one individual?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Impossibilities that are probable are more useful than possibilities that are improbable - Aristotle (from Poetics)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes death is not the ultimate deterrent because poverty drives necessity of action&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Desire and hope, one leads and one wants.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The descriptions of plague and massacres are horrific and are almost parallel to recent events in human history. One particular example of the massacre of a school at Mykalessos by barbaric Thracian mercenaries show cased how humanity can evaporate in an instant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intense rivalry between Cleon and Nicias. One a war mongerer and the other a self-interested peace keeper (Nicias owned vast tracts of land).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conclusion: The true enemy of Athens was Athens itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Being You by Anil Seth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/being.png&quot; alt=&quot;Being You&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consciousness has always been a topic that intrigued me. Especially after years of developing artificial intelligence systems, I have always wondered what kind of a task it would be to emulate or even create consciousness with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book unpacks a lot of material from the neuroscience world introducing readers to concepts that may or may not have been evident before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A very interesting use of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression algorithm to calculate the randomness and entropy rate of electrophysiological brain data. Using LZW, an algorithm that is used for example in .gif files, is such an intriguing concept. It makes sense that the higher the randomness of data, the harder it will be to compress and the less random the data, the higher the compression rate. This results in a measure of algorithmic complexity of our brains (wow!). Super interesting stuff and the utility of an algorithm that is from a completely different domain with completely different target use cases was mind-blowing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Order = integration, disorder = information in the sense of neuroscience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrated information theory basically posits that the system or the whole (integration) is greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Panpsychism theory brings forth the idea that even atoms experience consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being alive != conscious&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is consciousness stemmed from information from our senses combined with memories, reflexes and learnings resulting in the final integration in the form of consciousness?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interesting take on Bayesian inference and the feedback loop of: a priori -&amp;gt; likelihoods -&amp;gt; a posteriori. Reliability of information is critical here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humans are incredibly bad at measuring or judging time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teletrasportation paradox brings incredible ethical and legal questions that require a deep understanding of consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free energy principle posits that all life is “programmed” to reduce free energy and thus reduce entropy to get to an equilibrium state. It states that the brain is essentially an inference engine that tries to determine the states to do reduce free energy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interesting use of allostasis in the sense of change of the body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technology is already working majorly on our consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cerebral organoids look to be super interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/order.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Order of Time&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written by the physicist Carlo Rovelli, this is a really fascinating take on explaining one of the hardest aspects of our reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Horace verses at the start of every chapter is interesting, almost poignant, as there are interspersed hints that even our ancient forefathers were thinking deeply on the questions of time and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our language is inadequate in explaining hard concepts including time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time describes events, change and relations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interesting interpretation of time by Aristotle where a perspective of relativity is evident and the measure of change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time evolves from a world without time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The universe stats in a state of low entropy and change increases entropy, therefore in its inextricably linked with time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd law of thermodynamics is used to explain that entropy can never go below 0 and in a way imitates time as it goes in one direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is entropy relative?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We get low entropy in form of photons from the Sun, close to the pure form of low entropy from the beginnings of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The movement of particles results in heat and is ultimately the change we experience that then becomes an event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our brains adapted to the concept of time using terms like past, present and future for survival but these terms do not make sense in the universe itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Music can synchronize humans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The concept of durations is an artifact of the human brain even though there is no such thing as the present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The Birth of Plenty: How the Prosperity of the Modern World Was Created by William J. Bernstein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/birth.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Birth of Plenty: How the Prosperity of the Modern World Was Created&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book explains how we go to where we are today where entrepreneurs are able to create, innovate and generate value for modern societies. The book provides a great socioeconomic thesis of the times we live in and the developments from history that allowed us to get to this point by identifying 4 critical pillars: Property/Intellectual Rights, Scientific Method and Rationale, Free Flowing Capital Markets and Transportation/Communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a society lacks even one of these pillars or conditions, it will end up being less prosperous and inefficient with regards to economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Athens (and the communities surrounding it) evolved to become democracies due the society’s agrarian nature and roots. There needed to be a way in splitting up lots for farming and agriculture and as such democracy was formed to power such decisions by vote.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Along with democracy, Athens also had a concept of property rights intertwined within their governance. However, they lacked the 3 other pillars and therefore the polity was not effective and efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Macedon and Sparta were anti-democratic and oligarchic in nature due to their environments situated in valleys or coasts, resulting in slavery and no property rights except for the people in power.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Dark Ages resulted in a completely collapse of all developments achieved by the ancients however was slowly rediscovered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Magna Carta was the pivotal event for English common law in diluting the monarchy’s powers and spreading it to the barons and clergy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The freeing up of the resources and major religious movements such as the English Reformation lead to the Scientific Method championed by Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the Scientific Method, society moved away from Aristotelian Natural Philosophy, empirical testing now allowed for rapid advancement in science&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low interest rates allowed for capital to flow to inventors and to fund their experiments powered by the Scientific Method&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before free flowing capital markets, property rights and the scientific method, people had no incentive to pursue innovation due to the feudal system that basically provided no reward or protection for inventors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free capital flow of markets were achieved in the Netherlands and then imitated by Great Britain achieving the lowest interest rates in Europe. It isn’t a coincidence that both of these empires relied heavily on intercontinental maritime trade that reduced dependence on agriculture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High interest rates in other countries was due to the the seasonal aspects of harvests resulting in interest rates around or more than 30% (!) as loans were tied to crop outputs. Innovation cannot happen at these high level of interest rates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investment banking and limited liability partnerships reduced liabilities for Dutch and British trade and was initiated by the need to mitigate and distribute risk among many investors versus only a couple, which could alleviate the disastrous effects for investors, in a time when vessels and ships would sink often.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transportation and communication effectiveness progressed rapidly after the Industrial revolution with the advent of the steam engine, telegraphs, cars. With an effective transportation and communication system, inventors can distribute their products effectively to customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

That is the &lt;strong&gt;ratings (or reviews) system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviews on the Internet had their major break back in 1995 when Amazon introduced, at that time, the groundbreaking method to share opinions online via the 5-star rating system.
However, this was not the first time a star rating system was used. For that, we need to go back to the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first printed evidence of a star rating system was in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray%27s_Handbooks_for_Travellers&quot;&gt;Murray’s Handbooks for Travellers&lt;/a&gt;. These handbooks were travel guides that were published starting in &lt;strong&gt;1836&lt;/strong&gt;. It is interesting to see how human psychology renders a star rating system an easy way to digest opinions on a subject, a system that has been tried and proven over a span of hundreds of years. Human psychology remains consistent even when the medium of delivery has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary reasons behind reading a review are obvious: to understand a product and the service surrounding the transaction. We cannot test, touch, feel or view the product in physical form and, as such, we rely on the opinions of other customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving deeper, reviews are critical in bringing confidence and trust for consumers when purchasing on marketplaces online. If a user views a review from a fellow customer, they are more than likely to have confidence to check out with the product as there is established validation. Cognitive biases are abound including a sprinkle of FOMO (&lt;em&gt;we’ll save that for a different post&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous studies/surveys done on this topic. To summarize, the general average of consumers that read reviews before any kind of purchasing decision is high and hovers around the &lt;strong&gt;93% mark&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/online-review-stats/&quot;&gt;(Qualtrics)&lt;/a&gt;. That is a significant percentage of users and, additionally, &lt;strong&gt;91% of 18-34 year olds trust reviews as much as a recommendation from a friend!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence of those orange stars is undeniable and we are increasingly dependent on them. Now, what if I told you those stars are flawed and can instead lead you to an unsatisfactory decision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s pull the curtain and take a peek behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bayesian/Black-box ML Averaging of Ratings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be shocked to find out that the average star rating that you see on platforms like Amazon and others is not a statistical average or mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodologies for the displayed final rating have evolved over the past decades. It has seen major changes with Bayesian averages being a standard for a while when it was leveraged to calculate and weigh reviews for the final rating on a variety of platforms (especially when only a few reviews were available).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayesian averages are highly dependent on the data size/population and it involves using the previous mean combined with a pre-existing belief in the form of a constant, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;. This constant is the number of observations from past data sets and is a core aspect of Bayesian interpretation. As the data size changes, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;, also fluctuates, and it can affect the final rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we see a rise of bespoke black-box systems that are dictated by machine learned models which factor various variables of a review to contribute to the average rating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQUXAMY73JFRVJHE&quot;&gt;(read here how Amazon explains it)&lt;/a&gt;. It is difficult to say if Bayesian averages are part of the final calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fake and Unreliable reviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the flour is spoiled, what quality of bread will it produce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the star rating average is unreliable if the data constituting it is contaminated with fake or unreliable reviews. As reviews power a rapidly growing digital economy, in tandem, fraud flourishes. The amount of trustworthy opinions has severely deteriorated since the turn of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, there was an average of &lt;strong&gt;30% of fake reviews&lt;/strong&gt; on popular eCommerce platforms and, by 2020, that number has skyrocketed to new highs we have never witnessed before. Fraudsters exploited the global lockdown situation by gamifying the review systems across the Internet to make a buck &lt;a href=&quot;https://saoudkhalifah.com/2020/10/19/lets-talk-about-fake-reviews-part-1&quot;&gt;(read more about it here)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, unfortunately, renders the star rating system completely useless in the face of a flood of fraud regardless of the fact if a true mean is calculated or a bespoke ML model is utilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, consumers have a couple of options to combat these flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researching a product across a variety of sources and looking up video reviews where the owner of the product you’re interested in is actually show-casing it (thus proving ownership) is highly recommended, especially when the product is a high priced item. If you can only find one source for ratings + reviews, make sure the store has a good return policy in case your experience with the product does not match up to the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, use an automated AI powered solution such as ours, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fakespot.com&quot;&gt;Fakespot&lt;/a&gt;, that makes reviews and, those stars, more trustworthy. Fakespot reports provide an Adjusted Rating that weighs reviews based off authenticity and then recalculates it with trust being the primary factor of the final adjusted rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what we have learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon, a 1.84 trillion dollar company (!!), launched a coordinated PR attack to spread lies and disinformation about Fakespot (we have raised around $7mm).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our internal data shows us that users were increasingly choosing the Fakespot app over Amazon’s own app to shop on their own platform (!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon has bought out keywords for “Fakespot” on the App Store and other places to control what people see. Unlimited resources at work to destroy our company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have Black Friday level traffic on our website and record level downloads (thanks Amazon!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just confirms that consumers do not trust Amazon and want Fakespot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Amazon doesn’t realize is that Fakespot is part of a powerful movement, a movement that is for the consumer and for the people. Their actions have confirmed (buying keywords on our name and spreading lies to the media) that deception is the only key strategy that works for Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Founder and CEO of Fakespot, I am incredibly proud and privileged to be leading a company that can accomplish such things. We are a platform that is for the consumer and people. Amazon’s actions only validate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t end here, stay tuned my fellow Fakespotters and friends. We have a lot of exciting developments to announce in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saoud Khalifah</name></author><summary type="html">It’s been a week since the Fakespot iOS app was taken down.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dear Jeff,</title><link href="https://saoudkhalifah.com/2021/07/19/dear-jeff" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dear Jeff," /><published>2021-07-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-07-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://saoudkhalifah.com/2021/07/19/dear-jeff</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://saoudkhalifah.com/2021/07/19/dear-jeff">&lt;p&gt;As you embark on your trip into space, you leave behind a company that claims to be the most customer-obsessed company on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear to us today that Amazon has lost its touch with reality, fighting and crushing smaller businesses like Fakespot, that actually help consumers fight fake reviews and scams on Amazon. We empower consumers with data to make more informed decisions about their purchase decisions, but apparently Amazon does not care about consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions to remove Fakespot from the App Store prove that Amazon is not a customer-obsessed company. Instead, Amazon is profit-obsessed and will do anything to hide the truth from its customers. Consumers and the people deserve much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has grown so much and so fast that the amount of fraud on the platform exploded in lockstep. You lead a brainwashing marketing campaign to convince us all that Amazon is the best thing for consumers because of low prices and easy returns. The prices on Amazon aren’t even the best anymore. Consumers have become so dependent on Amazon because we pay for Prime every year, even when the cost goes up, and that initial Prime investment causes us to think twice about going to a competitor because we already paid for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff, this great power you wield demands great responsibility. You have not done enough to protect us from brands and sellers who lie, cheat and deceive. You make your own rules and ignore the law to do whatever you want, to whomever you want, including your own corporate and warehouse employees. This is not what an ethical, responsible, and inclusive technology company should be doing, but there is more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all think we are only buying products from Amazon, but at the end of day, we are the actual product. Amazon knows more about their customers than any other company. But armed with a monstrous corporate PR machine you get away with it and you’re only considered an eCommerce marketplace with a giant smile for a face. Amazon, through its fly-wheel, has enough data to know who our partners are, what medical conditions we have, what income bracket we’re in, and on and on. You have a treasure trove of data about all of us. This is what I would call the greatest heist of the 21st century. It was achieved by duping all of us into thinking that Amazon is actually a net-positive creation for society and something that we actually needed in our lives. The enlightenment is here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I checked on customer-centricity, it did not involve knowing who our partners are and what ailments we have. When did you lose sight of that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fakespot and the apps we build, protect consumers from all of these problems and bring radical transparency to the Amazon platform. You may not realize it, but Fakespot was actually started after I was ripped off on Amazon after seeing that you were doing nothing about it. Now we are in 2021 and the problem has only grown exponentially. Fakespot has been innovating and growing to solve the problems of fake reviews, deceptive sellers and eCommerce fraud because you have failed to protect your own consumers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a shame that Amazon considers Fakespot a threat. We are a small 20-person team based in New York City that is supremely passionate about bringing back trust to the Internet and eradicating the problems you’ve failed so hard at fixing. While we are working on solving the problem of disinformation on the Internet, your team is working hard to destroy us. The reasons Amazon has listed for the takedown notice to Apple for our iOS app are deceptive, misleading and untruthful, just like the many reviews on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you enter space while looking back on Earth, I hope you ask yourself the question: Which side am I on? The consumer or my never-ending wallet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

Latin for &lt;strong&gt;“Let the buyer beware/be wary”&lt;/strong&gt;, an Ancient Roman concept and maxim that is part of modern law and economic contract principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the phrase puts forward that the responsibility is on the buyer for the due diligence on the product that they will be purchasing from a seller. The buyer has to ascertain and be satisfied the product fits the seller’s description. It is fascinating to see that humans and their interactions haven’t really changed much since the early days of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we analyze the phrase further, it can be said that the seller has more information about the product or service than you, the buyer. As such, the buyer has to counteract this lack of information by conducting research, vetting and verification. This imbalance of information between the buyer and seller is part of a subject in economics, security and contract theory named &lt;strong&gt;Information Asymmetry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Asymmetry&lt;/strong&gt; is a broad concept that can be applied beyond the domain of buyer and seller transactions, including markets, game theory, governance, diplomacy and much more. We will focus on the classic buyer and seller transaction in the digital realm showing how information asymmetry affects you today, &lt;em&gt;perhaps even without you knowing it!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Ubers, Grubhubs and Amazons of the world provide us with services and products that we are increasingly dependent on, in our modern, digitally intertwined lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think back 10 years to see how you were using the Internet compared with today, you will come to a realization that you are buying more online and relying on apps/services more than ever before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many of us pay for &lt;em&gt;one or more subscriptions&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many of us &lt;em&gt;shop on Amazon&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many of us had a &lt;em&gt;telemedicine call&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these questions holds an element of information asymmetry that has been shaped by the platform that hosted the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its simplest form, information asymmetry can be visualized as a balance. Below is a diagram when the state of &lt;strong&gt;perfect information&lt;/strong&gt; is achieved, where the seller and buyer have equal amounts of information between them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/perfect_information.png&quot; alt=&quot;Perfect_Information&quot; style=&quot;width: 950px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of perfect information between a seller and buyer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for consumers today, the information asymmetry in a digital transaction usually looks like this &lt;strong&gt;and it continues to trend downwards for the buyer&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/imperfect_information.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imperfect_Information&quot; style=&quot;width: 900px; margin-left: 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of imperfect information, the seller has the advantege over the buyer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the diagram above and end up asking yourself the questions &lt;strong&gt;“Why is that?”&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;“How is that even possible?”&lt;/strong&gt;, you have already self-admitted to having less information than the seller in the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this, let’s examine how we interact with Amazon, the largest eCommerce platform on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By signing up on Amazon, and buying on the platform, we have already provided Amazon a wealth of data about ourselves. What categories of products we tend to buy, what brands we favor, how big our family is, what is our income bracket, what medical conditions do we have and so on. At this point, you are at a disadvantage, information wise, and the platform that hosts you knows more about you than you do, about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say we are ready to buy something on Amazon, and as a consumer, you trust all the information you see on a product listing Amazon. After all, Amazon’s logo is a big yellow smile, how can you not trust the information on the website. Here again is another huge disadvantage. Armed with the knowledge that over &lt;strong&gt;40% of reviews of Amazon are fake&lt;/strong&gt;, the chances of getting a &lt;strong&gt;used or counterfeit product is increasing&lt;/strong&gt;, and that you may buy a product from a 3rd party seller that may use your information for &lt;strong&gt;nefarious purposes&lt;/strong&gt; (such as solicitation and marketing), the symmetry of information can be clearly drawn. You as a buyer are stuck in a &lt;em&gt;flywheel of misinformation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most interesting about the information asymmetry case on Amazon is how historically the balance of information between you (&lt;em&gt;the buyer&lt;/em&gt;) and Amazon (&lt;em&gt;the seller&lt;/em&gt;) has been dramatically changing. The lowering of the balance of information on the buyer’s side is evident, as Amazon got better in analyzing personal information and millions of third party sellers dominate the platform. It is not hard to see that &lt;strong&gt;information asymmetry is a critical component&lt;/strong&gt; of the business model that these platforms operate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have used Amazon (or other equally sized behemoths) for the last 20 years, you can confidently see how skewed the information asymmetry balance is in favor of the platform versus the consumer. That’s how &lt;strong&gt;monopolies of knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; are formed, but that is a topic for another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information asymmetry is a concept that I have found myself always reminded of when we’re developing and building products at Fakespot&lt;/strong&gt;. At our core, the products that Fakespot provides to users revolves around research, vetting and verification of information to increase the balance in favor of the consumer versus the platforms. We are proud to be building a company that actually brings back the balance to the consumer as this was one of the reasons that brought Fakespot into existence, my disappointment in getting scammed on Amazon many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time information asymmetry affected you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen Facebook groups, WhatsApp groups, WeChat and many other social platforms hosting the meeting grounds for unscrupulous sellers/agencies/brands to get in touch with folks that would write reviews for their products, obviously in exchange for compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first detected the first signs of these types of promotional reviews in the tail end of 2015 and they exploded in volume by 2016 and 2017. The incentivized reviews had disclaimers that mentioned the review authors received products for free/compensation in exchange for writing the review. The amount of these types of compensated reviews reached epidemic levels and Amazon had to react. Amazon officially banned any reviews with text mentioning that kind of disclaimer in the late months of 2016 by doing specific keyword scanning within submitted reviews. The ripple effect of this ban is clearly seen today with social media platforms ending up hosting the subterfuge of Amazon sellers to obtain fake reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of a compensated review from 2017 for a book&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the companies in the data leak was a relatively well known brand that is a competitor to Anker, RAVPower and other brands in the electronic accessories space, a hotbed of fake reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular brand named Aukey was implicated in the data leak and had hundreds of listings taken down by Amazon. As of today, there were 292 listings on Amazon down 77% from 1,236 listings that Fakespot has analyzed with over close to half a million reviews &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fakespot.com/company/aukey&quot;&gt;(https://www.fakespot.com/company/aukey)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;AUKEY Fakespot Company Page Screenshot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the average Fakespot grade and adjusted rating for the company’s products, the results aren’t flattering. We can say that it wasn’t a shock to see this brand (and others) be included in the data dump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subset  of Fakespot’s models have been trained specifically to pick up on signals that reviews and reviewers can be sourced via these promotional review campaigns. We believe these types of reviews are the more insidious fake reviews as they are mostly written by humans that have an intrinsic bias embedded. Fakespot’s engines look for a targeted amount of historic and present parameters to determine if the reviews belong to such a category and are pointed out to our users via our Fakespot grade or our reports with the deception level metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will this data leak change anything for the current trend of fake reviews on Amazon?&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think so. A lot of the banned sellers will be reinstated and probably a good amount of the reviews will be part of the Amazon “purges” (read my &lt;a href=&quot;https://saoudkhalifah.com/2020/10/19/lets-talk-about-fake-reviews-part-1&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; to understand these events) but it is a slap on the wrist and the fake review economy continues full steam ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when you have millions of 3rd party sellers running amok on the Amazon platform and so much profit to be gained by duping unsuspecting consumers with these types of reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

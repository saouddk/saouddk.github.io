That is the &lt;strong&gt;ratings (or reviews) system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviews on the Internet had their major break back in 1995 when Amazon introduced, at that time, the groundbreaking method to share opinions online via the 5-star rating system.
However, this was not the first time a star rating system was used. For that, we need to go back to the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first printed evidence of a star rating system was in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray%27s_Handbooks_for_Travellers&quot;&gt;Murray’s Handbooks for Travellers&lt;/a&gt;. These handbooks were travel guides that were published starting in &lt;strong&gt;1836&lt;/strong&gt;. It is interesting to see how human psychology renders a star rating system an easy way to digest opinions on a subject, a system that has been tried and proven over a span of hundreds of years. Human psychology remains consistent even when the medium of delivery has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary reasons behind reading a review are obvious: to understand a product and the service surrounding the transaction. We cannot test, touch, feel or view the product in physical form and, as such, we rely on the opinions of other customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving deeper, reviews are critical in bringing confidence and trust for consumers when purchasing on marketplaces online. If a user views a review from a fellow customer, they are more than likely to have confidence to check out with the product as there is established validation. Cognitive biases are abound including a sprinkle of FOMO (&lt;em&gt;we’ll save that for a different post&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous studies/surveys done on this topic. To summarize, the general average of consumers that read reviews before any kind of purchasing decision is high and hovers around the &lt;strong&gt;93% mark&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/online-review-stats/&quot;&gt;(Qualtrics)&lt;/a&gt;. That is a significant percentage of users and, additionally, &lt;strong&gt;91% of 18-34 year olds trust reviews as much as a recommendation from a friend!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence of those orange stars is undeniable and we are increasingly dependent on them. Now, what if I told you those stars are flawed and can instead lead you to an unsatisfactory decision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s pull the curtain and take a peek behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bayesian/Black-box ML Averaging of Ratings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be shocked to find out that the average star rating that you see on platforms like Amazon and others is not a statistical average or mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodologies for the displayed final rating have evolved over the past decades. It has seen major changes with Bayesian averages being a standard for a while when it was leveraged to calculate and weigh reviews for the final rating on a variety of platforms (especially when only a few reviews were available).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayesian averages are highly dependent on the data size/population and it involves using the previous mean combined with a pre-existing belief in the form of a constant, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;. This constant is the number of observations from past data sets and is a core aspect of Bayesian interpretation. As the data size changes, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;, also fluctuates, and it can affect the final rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we see a rise of bespoke black-box systems that are dictated by machine learned models which factor various variables of a review to contribute to the average rating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQUXAMY73JFRVJHE&quot;&gt;(read here how Amazon explains it)&lt;/a&gt;. It is difficult to say if Bayesian averages are part of the final calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fake and Unreliable reviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the flour is spoiled, what quality of bread will it produce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the star rating average is unreliable if the data constituting it is contaminated with fake or unreliable reviews. As reviews power a rapidly growing digital economy, in tandem, fraud flourishes. The amount of trustworthy opinions has severely deteriorated since the turn of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, there was an average of &lt;strong&gt;30% of fake reviews&lt;/strong&gt; on popular eCommerce platforms and, by 2020, that number has skyrocketed to new highs we have never witnessed before. Fraudsters exploited the global lockdown situation by gamifying the review systems across the Internet to make a buck &lt;a href=&quot;https://saoudkhalifah.com/2020/10/19/lets-talk-about-fake-reviews-part-1&quot;&gt;(read more about it here)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, unfortunately, renders the star rating system completely useless in the face of a flood of fraud regardless of the fact if a true mean is calculated or a bespoke ML model is utilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, consumers have a couple of options to combat these flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researching a product across a variety of sources and looking up video reviews where the owner of the product you’re interested in is actually show-casing it (thus proving ownership) is highly recommended, especially when the product is a high priced item. If you can only find one source for ratings + reviews, make sure the store has a good return policy in case your experience with the product does not match up to the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, use an automated AI powered solution such as ours, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fakespot.com&quot;&gt;Fakespot&lt;/a&gt;, that makes reviews and, those stars, more trustworthy. Fakespot reports provide an Adjusted Rating that weighs reviews based off authenticity and then recalculates it with trust being the primary factor of the final adjusted rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what we have learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon, a 1.84 trillion dollar company (!!), launched a coordinated PR attack to spread lies and disinformation about Fakespot (we have raised around $7mm).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our internal data shows us that users were increasingly choosing the Fakespot app over Amazon’s own app to shop on their own platform (!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon has bought out keywords for “Fakespot” on the App Store and other places to control what people see. Unlimited resources at work to destroy our company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have Black Friday level traffic on our website and record level downloads (thanks Amazon!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just confirms that consumers do not trust Amazon and want Fakespot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Amazon doesn’t realize is that Fakespot is part of a powerful movement, a movement that is for the consumer and for the people. Their actions have confirmed (buying keywords on our name and spreading lies to the media) that deception is the only key strategy that works for Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Founder and CEO of Fakespot, I am incredibly proud and privileged to be leading a company that can accomplish such things. We are a platform that is for the consumer and people. Amazon’s actions only validate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t end here, stay tuned my fellow Fakespotters and friends. We have a lot of exciting developments to announce in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saoud Khalifah</name></author><summary type="html">It’s been a week since the Fakespot iOS app was taken down.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dear Jeff,</title><link href="https://saoudkhalifah.com/2021/07/19/dear-jeff" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dear Jeff," /><published>2021-07-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-07-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://saoudkhalifah.com/2021/07/19/dear-jeff</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://saoudkhalifah.com/2021/07/19/dear-jeff">&lt;p&gt;As you embark on your trip into space, you leave behind a company that claims to be the most customer-obsessed company on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear to us today that Amazon has lost its touch with reality, fighting and crushing smaller businesses like Fakespot, that actually help consumers fight fake reviews and scams on Amazon. We empower consumers with data to make more informed decisions about their purchase decisions, but apparently Amazon does not care about consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions to remove Fakespot from the App Store prove that Amazon is not a customer-obsessed company. Instead, Amazon is profit-obsessed and will do anything to hide the truth from its customers. Consumers and the people deserve much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has grown so much and so fast that the amount of fraud on the platform exploded in lockstep. You lead a brainwashing marketing campaign to convince us all that Amazon is the best thing for consumers because of low prices and easy returns. The prices on Amazon aren’t even the best anymore. Consumers have become so dependent on Amazon because we pay for Prime every year, even when the cost goes up, and that initial Prime investment causes us to think twice about going to a competitor because we already paid for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff, this great power you wield demands great responsibility. You have not done enough to protect us from brands and sellers who lie, cheat and deceive. You make your own rules and ignore the law to do whatever you want, to whomever you want, including your own corporate and warehouse employees. This is not what an ethical, responsible, and inclusive technology company should be doing, but there is more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all think we are only buying products from Amazon, but at the end of day, we are the actual product. Amazon knows more about their customers than any other company. But armed with a monstrous corporate PR machine you get away with it and you’re only considered an eCommerce marketplace with a giant smile for a face. Amazon, through its fly-wheel, has enough data to know who our partners are, what medical conditions we have, what income bracket we’re in, and on and on. You have a treasure trove of data about all of us. This is what I would call the greatest heist of the 21st century. It was achieved by duping all of us into thinking that Amazon is actually a net-positive creation for society and something that we actually needed in our lives. The enlightenment is here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I checked on customer-centricity, it did not involve knowing who our partners are and what ailments we have. When did you lose sight of that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fakespot and the apps we build, protect consumers from all of these problems and bring radical transparency to the Amazon platform. You may not realize it, but Fakespot was actually started after I was ripped off on Amazon after seeing that you were doing nothing about it. Now we are in 2021 and the problem has only grown exponentially. Fakespot has been innovating and growing to solve the problems of fake reviews, deceptive sellers and eCommerce fraud because you have failed to protect your own consumers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a shame that Amazon considers Fakespot a threat. We are a small 20-person team based in New York City that is supremely passionate about bringing back trust to the Internet and eradicating the problems you’ve failed so hard at fixing. While we are working on solving the problem of disinformation on the Internet, your team is working hard to destroy us. The reasons Amazon has listed for the takedown notice to Apple for our iOS app are deceptive, misleading and untruthful, just like the many reviews on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you enter space while looking back on Earth, I hope you ask yourself the question: Which side am I on? The consumer or my never-ending wallet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

Latin for &lt;strong&gt;“Let the buyer beware/be wary”&lt;/strong&gt;, an Ancient Roman concept and maxim that is part of modern law and economic contract principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the phrase puts forward that the responsibility is on the buyer for the due diligence on the product that they will be purchasing from a seller. The buyer has to ascertain and be satisfied the product fits the seller’s description. It is fascinating to see that humans and their interactions haven’t really changed much since the early days of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we analyze the phrase further, it can be said that the seller has more information about the product or service than you, the buyer. As such, the buyer has to counteract this lack of information by conducting research, vetting and verification. This imbalance of information between the buyer and seller is part of a subject in economics, security and contract theory named &lt;strong&gt;Information Asymmetry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Asymmetry&lt;/strong&gt; is a broad concept that can be applied beyond the domain of buyer and seller transactions, including markets, game theory, governance, diplomacy and much more. We will focus on the classic buyer and seller transaction in the digital realm showing how information asymmetry affects you today, &lt;em&gt;perhaps even without you knowing it!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Ubers, Grubhubs and Amazons of the world provide us with services and products that we are increasingly dependent on, in our modern, digitally intertwined lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think back 10 years to see how you were using the Internet compared with today, you will come to a realization that you are buying more online and relying on apps/services more than ever before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many of us pay for &lt;em&gt;one or more subscriptions&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many of us &lt;em&gt;shop on Amazon&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many of us had a &lt;em&gt;telemedicine call&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these questions holds an element of information asymmetry that has been shaped by the platform that hosted the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its simplest form, information asymmetry can be visualized as a balance. Below is a diagram when the state of &lt;strong&gt;perfect information&lt;/strong&gt; is achieved, where the seller and buyer have equal amounts of information between them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/perfect_information.png&quot; alt=&quot;Perfect_Information&quot; style=&quot;width: 950px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of perfect information between a seller and buyer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for consumers today, the information asymmetry in a digital transaction usually looks like this &lt;strong&gt;and it continues to trend downwards for the buyer&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/imperfect_information.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imperfect_Information&quot; style=&quot;width: 900px; margin-left: 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of imperfect information, the seller has the advantege over the buyer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the diagram above and end up asking yourself the questions &lt;strong&gt;“Why is that?”&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;“How is that even possible?”&lt;/strong&gt;, you have already self-admitted to having less information than the seller in the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this, let’s examine how we interact with Amazon, the largest eCommerce platform on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By signing up on Amazon, and buying on the platform, we have already provided Amazon a wealth of data about ourselves. What categories of products we tend to buy, what brands we favor, how big our family is, what is our income bracket, what medical conditions do we have and so on. At this point, you are at a disadvantage, information wise, and the platform that hosts you knows more about you than you do, about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say we are ready to buy something on Amazon, and as a consumer, you trust all the information you see on a product listing Amazon. After all, Amazon’s logo is a big yellow smile, how can you not trust the information on the website. Here again is another huge disadvantage. Armed with the knowledge that over &lt;strong&gt;40% of reviews of Amazon are fake&lt;/strong&gt;, the chances of getting a &lt;strong&gt;used or counterfeit product is increasing&lt;/strong&gt;, and that you may buy a product from a 3rd party seller that may use your information for &lt;strong&gt;nefarious purposes&lt;/strong&gt; (such as solicitation and marketing), the symmetry of information can be clearly drawn. You as a buyer are stuck in a &lt;em&gt;flywheel of misinformation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most interesting about the information asymmetry case on Amazon is how historically the balance of information between you (&lt;em&gt;the buyer&lt;/em&gt;) and Amazon (&lt;em&gt;the seller&lt;/em&gt;) has been dramatically changing. The lowering of the balance of information on the buyer’s side is evident, as Amazon got better in analyzing personal information and millions of third party sellers dominate the platform. It is not hard to see that &lt;strong&gt;information asymmetry is a critical component&lt;/strong&gt; of the business model that these platforms operate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have used Amazon (or other equally sized behemoths) for the last 20 years, you can confidently see how skewed the information asymmetry balance is in favor of the platform versus the consumer. That’s how &lt;strong&gt;monopolies of knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; are formed, but that is a topic for another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information asymmetry is a concept that I have found myself always reminded of when we’re developing and building products at Fakespot&lt;/strong&gt;. At our core, the products that Fakespot provides to users revolves around research, vetting and verification of information to increase the balance in favor of the consumer versus the platforms. We are proud to be building a company that actually brings back the balance to the consumer as this was one of the reasons that brought Fakespot into existence, my disappointment in getting scammed on Amazon many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time information asymmetry affected you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen Facebook groups, WhatsApp groups, WeChat and many other social platforms hosting the meeting grounds for unscrupulous sellers/agencies/brands to get in touch with folks that would write reviews for their products, obviously in exchange for compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first detected the first signs of these types of promotional reviews in the tail end of 2015 and they exploded in volume by 2016 and 2017. The incentivized reviews had disclaimers that mentioned the review authors received products for free/compensation in exchange for writing the review. The amount of these types of compensated reviews reached epidemic levels and Amazon had to react. Amazon officially banned any reviews with text mentioning that kind of disclaimer in the late months of 2016 by doing specific keyword scanning within submitted reviews. The ripple effect of this ban is clearly seen today with social media platforms ending up hosting the subterfuge of Amazon sellers to obtain fake reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/compensated_review.png&quot; alt=&quot;An example of a compensated review from 2017 for a book&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; max-width: 700px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of a compensated review from 2017 for a book&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the companies in the data leak was a relatively well known brand that is a competitor to Anker, RAVPower and other brands in the electronic accessories space, a hotbed of fake reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular brand named Aukey was implicated in the data leak and had hundreds of listings taken down by Amazon. As of today, there were 292 listings on Amazon down 77% from 1,236 listings that Fakespot has analyzed with over close to half a million reviews &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fakespot.com/company/aukey&quot;&gt;(https://www.fakespot.com/company/aukey)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;AUKEY Fakespot Company Page Screenshot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the average Fakespot grade and adjusted rating for the company’s products, the results aren’t flattering. We can say that it wasn’t a shock to see this brand (and others) be included in the data dump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subset  of Fakespot’s models have been trained specifically to pick up on signals that reviews and reviewers can be sourced via these promotional review campaigns. We believe these types of reviews are the more insidious fake reviews as they are mostly written by humans that have an intrinsic bias embedded. Fakespot’s engines look for a targeted amount of historic and present parameters to determine if the reviews belong to such a category and are pointed out to our users via our Fakespot grade or our reports with the deception level metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will this data leak change anything for the current trend of fake reviews on Amazon?&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think so. A lot of the banned sellers will be reinstated and probably a good amount of the reviews will be part of the Amazon “purges” (read my &lt;a href=&quot;https://saoudkhalifah.com/2020/10/19/lets-talk-about-fake-reviews-part-1&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; to understand these events) but it is a slap on the wrist and the fake review economy continues full steam ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when you have millions of 3rd party sellers running amok on the Amazon platform and so much profit to be gained by duping unsuspecting consumers with these types of reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on who you are asking, the answers vary:&lt;br /&gt;
Power, comfort, land .. maybe even a sprinkle of Fake News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your influence? Is that for sale?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the explosive rise of TikTok, it was only a matter of time until we started seeing videos such as the ones in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/12/15/22174581/walmart-amazon-tiktok-employee-worker-influencer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this article by Vox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees in the monster factory warehouses of Amazon are now using the social platform as a medium to showcase the dark side of getting your shipment in 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state of constant surveillance, optimized algorithmic performance evaluations, and being a human robot are hallmarks of the job. More and more videos trickle onto social media uncovering the reality of modern commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the table, this must look like an onslaught of nightmare PR and press. How do you fight this fire that only seems to be growing and growing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would depend on the size of your treasury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a treasury the size of several countries cumulative GDP, you might as well fight fire with fire, change peoples’ perceptions and distort reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An army of influencers fighting under the banner of the wronged and the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait.. which side is the wronged one again? The Influencer Amnesia has struck, yet again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a feedback loop running right in-front of us. The influencers posting rave tweets and posts are also the ones that are buying fake followers, upvotes and many more. The savage cycle only repeats itself and proliferates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like the industry is too far gone to revert. What is even more astounding is that buying influencers doesn’t just limit itself to PR and media. Every facet of the Internet is affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influencers aren’t only working to improve companies’ reputations by tweeting or using TikTok. By now, it should come as no surprise that &lt;a href=&quot;https://saoudkhalifah.com/2020/10/19/lets-talk-about-fake-reviews-part-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more than 40%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (!) of the reviews you’re reading may have been manipulated and are unreliable. These types of campaigns are only growing with more reviews being written with the only intent to influence you and your buying decision. Without you even knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

It is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; primary reason Fakespot was created. Fakespot was launched after I was scammed on Amazon with a product that had hundreds of fake reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reading the reviews for this product, it was obvious that the seller had implanted fake reviews with the use of bots, spiced up with some human input. The product was freshly launched and it had &lt;em&gt;hundreds of 5 star reviews&lt;/em&gt; in a matter of hours for a completely no name brand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already familiar with black hat techniques fraudsters use to increase their listings’ rankings due to my security background, a passion I developed in my early teenage years. In case you were wondering… Yes, I was a hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of 18, I submitted my first bug bounties to the Zero Day Initiative, a pioneer of the bug bounty programs when there were none. The first vulnerability I discovered was a &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft PowerPoint&lt;/strong&gt; buffer overflow. My research later lead me to finding bugs in software ranging from &lt;strong&gt;Adobe PDF Reader&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;WinAmp&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Foxit&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;VLC Player&lt;/strong&gt; to some more &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;check out my publicly published vulnerabilities/exploits &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.exploit-db.com/search?e_author=skd&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you’re curious&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/metasploit_pp_exploit.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Metasploit module for the PowerPoint vulnerability I found way back in the day.&quot; style=&quot;border: 2px solid black; max-width: 700px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Metasploit module for the PowerPoint vulnerability I found way back in the day.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funny story: I applied for a Microsoft internship at the time I received the payout for the bug bounty. Back in those days, Microsoft was notorious for “hating” on anyone who would find weaknesses in their products especially security researchers. Needless to say, they immediately rejected my application. It just shows how much Microsoft has changed since then.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My love for security has taught me that, reverse engineering to the lowest level is always critical. Especially, if you want to understand the fundamentals and scope to the problem you are encountering. That mindset helped me discover a completely different class of vulnerabilities altogether, the social context vulnerabilities in eCommerce: &lt;strong&gt;fake reviews&lt;/strong&gt; and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fakespot was initially built to automate the process of analyzing the trustworthiness of reviews. After all, who has hours of free time to dissect and verify the reviews they’re reading? Since the launch of Fakespot in 2015, the state of fake reviews and eCommerce fraud has emerged and evolved in ways that I wouldn’t have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving in to fake reviews and eCommerce fraud, let’s talk about eCommerce and take a look at the total volume and growth of sales:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/shopify_sales_graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;eCommerce past years growth and forecast for 2021 - Source: Shopify&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;eCommerce past years growth and forecast for 2021 - Source: Shopify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eCommerce sales are forecast to be close to &lt;em&gt;$4 trillion dollars&lt;/em&gt; this year. That is &lt;em&gt;nearly 20%&lt;/em&gt; of the GDP for the United States in 2019 alone. These numbers are astonishing and showcase the vast opportunities in eCommerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more sales happen online in the year of 2020. We can only see eCommerce gobbling up even more sales from brick and mortal retail as consumers work from home in quarantine. This is indeed the era of the &lt;em&gt;digital gold rush&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Make no mistake, it also the era of the digital Wild West.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/wild_west_meme.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;That's the truth, Clint.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;That’s the truth, Clint.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into trends we see with fake reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fakespot has analyzed over &lt;strong&gt;8 billion reviews&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;1 billion reviewers&lt;/strong&gt; and served over &lt;strong&gt;20 million users&lt;/strong&gt; visiting &lt;strong&gt;fakespot.com&lt;/strong&gt;. From our analysis, we can clearly understand the trends that show the increase in fraud over the last 3 years with each month in comparison:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/fakespot_avg_graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;The monthly average of analyses that had &amp;gt;= 30% unreliable reviews - Source: Fakespot&quot; style=&quot;border: 2px solid black;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The monthly average of analyses that had &amp;gt;= 30% unreliable reviews - Source: Fakespot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data unveils the whole story for the trend of fake reviews. We have comparable rises each year in the amount of unreliable reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the averages from March 2020 to August 2020 reached &lt;strong&gt;record numbers never seen before&lt;/strong&gt;. This sequence of increases would only occur in Black Friday and Christmas shopping seasons of prior years. Sellers are quoted as saying “It was Black Friday everyday” &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/people-shopping-more-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; and we all experienced the widespread stock depletion on Amazon and other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also take note that in September 2020 Amazon significantly &lt;strong&gt;purged&lt;/strong&gt;, albeit in a delayed fashion, a large chunk of fake reviews to move it down from the &lt;strong&gt;43.75%&lt;/strong&gt; average we see in August. Likely, in preparation for Prime Day and the impending holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year is quite different, &lt;em&gt;to say the least&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the majority of the world went into lockdown the importance of reviews increases for sellers and consumers alike. We shop online, unable to judge the product by touching, feeling and physically testing it. Thus, we heavily rely on the opinions of others that have purchased the product. &lt;strong&gt;I believe one of the great innovations of the Internet is shared knowledge, and reviews are a conduit of that.&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately, sellers also know that reviews can make or break their sales and they are abusing that to the maximum for their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This overview of the general trends is useful in understanding the scale of eCommerce fraud. Fake reviews and the fraud surrounding eCommerce is extensive, complex and deep. To go through all the topics requires a sequence of posts with this being the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/fakespot_highlights.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Fakespot Highlights&quot; style=&quot;border: 2px solid black;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fakespot Highlights will organize relevant information into 5 categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;What is the product’s quality and characteristics?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packaging/appearance&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;How is the product’s packaging and physical attributes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitiveness&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;How does the product stack up to the competition?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;What was the general experience with the product’s shipping?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;How was/is the price?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlights will also further categorize the details by sentiment with Positive, Neutral and Negative sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new feature is powered by multiple machine learned models, both supervised and unsupervised, built by our talented data science team. The models were trained on over 7 billion+ reviews using our proprietary in-house stack that delivers blazing fast results in an eCommerce setting. That means no 3rd party APIs and no reliance on outside solutions (always awesome in my book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try Fakespot Highlights, download our &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fakespot-analyze-fake-ama/nakplnnackehceedgkgkokbgbmfghain&quot;&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;.

I would also recommend analyzing a product you’ve owned for a while and see if the Highlights match your personal experience!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;A seller has committed shipping fraud by not shipping items or scamming users.&lt;/li&gt;

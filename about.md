Welcome to my personal blog, where I share my thoughts and experiences as a tech entrepreneur and software creator.

I was the Founder & CEO of Fakespot (acquired by Mozilla), and before that, I worked at Goldman Sachs. 

I write on a range of topics, with my core interests being software, philosophy, artificial intelligence, and startups.

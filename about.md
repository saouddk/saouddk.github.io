Welcome to my blog, where I share my thoughts as a tech entrepreneur and software creator.

I was the Founder & CEO/CTO of Fakespot (acquired by Mozilla), and prior to that, I worked at Goldman Sachs.

My journey began at 11 when my first love became programming and building software. It started with Visual Basic 6.0, creating DragonBallZ games for my brother and friends, then progressed to C/C++, Delphi/Pascal, Assembly, and many other languages as I sought to push the limits of what I could create.

That passion for programming eventually evolved into security, where I spent years hacking and reverse-engineering software in Assembly to uncover vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and memory corruption. If you dig deep enough, you can still find some of my disclosures online from my teenage years.

During those years, I also sold my first of multiple software licenses for applications I authored. That was the moment I officially caught the entrepreneur bug and the rest is history.

I write on a range of topics, with my core interests being software, philosophy, artificial intelligence, and startups.

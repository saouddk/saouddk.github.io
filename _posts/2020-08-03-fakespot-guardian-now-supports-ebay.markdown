I am excited to announce that our Fakespot Chrome extension is now able to detect fraudulent, bot, fake and counterfeit sellers on all the English based eBay websites. 

You will be able to determine the authenticity of a seller by using Fakespot Guard that will display a badge on the eBay listing page. 

The Fakespot Guard badge will let you know if:
- A seller has sold counterfeits.
- A seller has fraud shipped, not shipped items or scammed users before.
- A seller account got hacked and is now listing fake listings.
- Many more detection methods that utilize our powerful Fakespot artificial intelligence analysis.
